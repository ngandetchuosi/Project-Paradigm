# Project-Paradigm

This is a simplistic redesign of a website.

## Description

In this project, I will be redesigning a website for illustration and practice purposes for myself. I will only be doing 3 website pages, so as to simplify the process, due to a time constraint. I will be using the Figma software to complete this. My goal is to try and not use any widgets or plugins, so that I can properly practice and shape my skills. 

>(P.S. Dear future me, don't forget that figma can convert the designs to HTML and CSS, so no need to redo this with them, instead do another project with just HTML and CSS to properly practice.)

> **Note**
> To anyone viewing this, please take note that as of now, this project is not completely done and there are a lot of design tweaks that need to be made, such as the box shadow, proportions, and just the size in general. I would appreciate it. Have a good day.

### Future Revisions

* I would love to build the website on WordPress
* Redesigning the rest of the pages on the website.
* Doing more research on the font and color
* Adding a Mobile Version
* Making the website more responsive and accessible
* ETC...
